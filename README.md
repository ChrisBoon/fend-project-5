# Project: Neighborhood Map

## Instructions

### To view hosted version GitHub:
http://chrisboon.github.io/fend-project-5

### To view a hosted version where Google Maps fails to load (due to a misspelled URL, but intention is to simulate server failure):
http://chrisboon.github.io/fend-project-5/index2.html


### Github repo:
https://github.com/ChrisBoon/fend-project-5

### To view locally once downloaded:
For minified, compressed, and optimized files view the 'dist' folder.
To see my working files view the 'app' folder.

## Build Process
The Github reo actually includes the built files for the purposes of Udacity grading. However should you wish to download and run the build yourself you will need Grunt and node.js. If you don't have them installed you can find out more here:
http://gruntjs.com/
https://nodejs.org/en/

Once you have installed grunt, use the command line to cd into the root directory and type 'grunt' to run the default build task. This will perform various optimzations and start a server at localhost:3000
There is also a 'dist' task that copies over only the essential files to the 'dist' folder.
